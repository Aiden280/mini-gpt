TAAGPT is a simple and easy-to-understand GPT kernel that includes a trainer, a web interface for loss functions, and a small training model. By installing TAAGPT locally, you can learn the basic structure and training methods of the Transformer.

To install TAAGPT, follow these steps:

From python official side: https://www.python.org/ to Install Python 3.10.11. Please be noted do not use python11 or python12.
Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install Torch, CUDA, and other required packages.
Run python main.py to start the web service, then execute the training code. A simple training program is provided, which can be run in another cmd window using python tests/test_adder.py.
Start your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the training process.
Please note that this project is still in its initial stages and additional features will be added gradually. The GPT kernel will also be modified accordingly. If you find any errors, please feel free to point them out and make changes. This project is released under the MIT License, completely open and free, and has no restrictions.
